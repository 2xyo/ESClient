CHANGELOG
=========

0.1.0
-----
From now on I will conform to the Semantic Versioning Guidelines outlined
on this site: http://semver.org/
In that spirit, I bumped the minor version to 0.1.0 and will keep doing so
until public API stability is reached.

0.0.1
-----
First official release that was published to PyPI. Alpha quality, but with
working unit tests for each API method.
