CHANGELOG
=========
0.2.0
* Removed option to choose between JSON or hierachy of Python objects. It
  would have created too much hassle.
* Added API methods: mget, ...
* small fixes here and there

0.1.1
-----
* Added docstring to the get API
* made sure that makedist.sh removes old MANIFEST file before making new
  package
* fixed version string in esclient.py


0.1.0
-----
From now on I will conform to the Semantic Versioning Guidelines outlined
on this site: http://semver.org/
In that spirit, I bumped the minor version to 0.1.0 and will keep doing so
until public API stability is reached.

0.0.1
-----
First official release that was published to PyPI. Alpha quality, but with
working unit tests for each API method.
