I used and adapted some code from `pyelasticsearch`_. Both that project and ESClient try to archieve the same thing: an easy to use Python library that helps in accessing the raw ElasticSearch REST API. I will keep looking at pyelasticsearch for inspiration but I also explicitly wanted to start my own project.
